    <p>Well really I'm just going to stall this and use as many words as I possibly can, often referencing several memes as that is the theme of this server. But as it seems necessary that I explain why it is a good thing that I am set free, I will do as you wish and explain every detail that could intrigue you. I am a thirteen year old human of the make gender currently taking up classes in seventh grade. In my free time I enjoy dabbling in stop motion animation and many other art related subjects. That was before I took up my school classes on my computer, and as a result, i am much less focused on my classes. I really wish I was more organised and focused on my online classes, but I actually spend more time using my mobile phone, and more specifically I use an app known to many as discord. This app has many different chat groups called servers, and I am a member to no few. Of all the discord servers that I take part in i especially enjoy spending time in one called r/memes. In this server whenever you are naughty you are forced to go to a special room called repent your sins. I have been sent there many times and i actually find it very saddening as I am separated from the people with whom I was having an organised conversation. I am currently typing this essay because I was naughty for using some bot commands in the general channel and as a result was told to write a five hundred word essay about why I should be set free from the channel that I am held up in. I really do beg that you set me free because I would like to get back to the nice chat that I was excused from as I was rather enjoying it. Now I'd better get going and I really do apologise if this didn't reach the five hundred work limit you asked for.</p>
